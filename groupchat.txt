[05:27, 10/2/2016] Wessje: You guys are probably just used to punishments like that
[05:28, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Im not sure about Canada but America atleast
[05:29, 10/2/2016] Wessje: I just think its to high for standards here
[05:32, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Anybody seen the night of?
[05:32, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Wess some dude fucked up at his job that hard its corporate sabotage

[05:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: How wil he ever be able to pay that fine
[05:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: For the rest of his life he wil suffeer from one mistake
[05:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: The rest of his life
[05:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: One mistake
[05:38, 10/2/2016] Wessje: He didnt even endanger anybody
[05:38, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Not even jobs from other people
[05:38, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Yet he has to suffer from one mistake for the rest of his life
[05:39, 10/2/2016] Wessje: People make mistakes and in my opinion you shouldn't be punished for the rest of you life for that
[05:41, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Why do you have so much empathy with this guy wess its pretty blinding I mean I mistake with intent isnt really a mistake m8
[05:41, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Thats why he got fined
[05:42, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Well my empathy is building up because your arguing with me.Before i was just think wow thats kinda harsh
[05:42, 10/2/2016] Wessje: I have to explain everything and think about how fucked he is
[05:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: I dont know how else to explain it in english
[05:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: I cant use the words that i would use in dutch
[05:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Arguing in a different language isn't easy
[05:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: And making a good an solid point
[05:44, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Well I mean arguing with no research is too
[05:44, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Who says i didn't do research
[05:44, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Because you read different facts then i do it instantly is that i dont do research?
[05:51, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: You dont understand how big of deal leaking is for the movie industry
[05:51, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: I mean they dump millions into anti piracy and its still a big enough deal for them that they fund massive campaigns agaisnt piracy as well and if you ever get hired at these studios they take you to workshops yearly about piracy and leaking
[05:51, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Its just yeah its not a matter of thats a harsh fine its a matter of that guys an idiot
[05:51, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Then everything else you said was just you empathasing
[05:59, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Yes, its illegal, and so it is right to be punished for this, but the punishment itself for copyright infringement I find increasingly out of proportion. A million loss? Is includes the compensation? Is included which the cinema against expectations remained stable despite global financial slump. Is it examined if all downloaders would actually legally pay for the movie? Is it examined whether the downloaders themselves never actually purchase content? Is included downloaders on average spend more on media than others. A million loss is rather one-sided linear number so. house arrest for eight months? is man is a danger to society? Is that proportionate with respect to the offense? Is the relative proportion of the damage sufferer. After a million a much greater impact for a private person than a million for a large multinational. The balance of the right beats in my opinion totally on the wrong side. Here, justice isnt done. This man deserves punishment, but this outcome literally destroyed the life of this man, where the damage for Twentieth Century besides that the amount is very dubious, even once the equivalent of a little itch on your back.
[05:59, 10/2/2016] Wessje: here a point made in dutch translated in english
[05:59, 10/2/2016] Wessje: by google translate
[05:59, 10/2/2016] Wessje: cus i am lazy
[06:00, 10/2/2016] Wessje: but whatever
[06:00, 10/2/2016] Wessje: its just an opinion
[06:01, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and its true i dont know how much that guy makes
[06:01, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and i dont know what is in his contract
[06:02, 10/2/2016] Wessje: im just giving my opinion about the punishment
[06:03, 10/2/2016] Wessje: probaply a lot of things in the text is not translated 100%
[06:05, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Wess law has precedent and to deter people from certain activitys espiecally when new ways to harm society er how it functions is to start a harsh precedent but regardless 1 mill is getting off easy if you look at what people have been fined with in the past also you the fine works as a loan you have to pay back gradually as a tax because the goverment gives the party in the right the money and the party in the wrong pay it back to the goverment
[06:06, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: It comes off your income tax
[06:19, 10/2/2016] Wessje: So if i understand it correctly, the law in america is their to scare people from committing crimes? and because other people got bigger fines it's ok to let that guy go off with a 1 mill fine?
[06:23, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Wess that is civil law that how it works and civil law is pretty ancient and your country has civil laws too i really dont understand they fine people that intentionally steal money or productsfrom a company
[06:24, 10/2/2016] Wessje: Im just not used to punishments that hars, people here get like a max fine of 50k
[06:24, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and that 50k was for uploading hundreds of moviesDutch Rabobank fined $1 billion over Libor scandalU.S. and European regulators have fined Dutch lender Rabobank $1 billion for rigging benchmark interest rates, making it the fifth bank punished in a scandal that has helped to shred faith in the industry.www.reuters.com

[06:26, 10/2/2016] Wessje: you know thats a company right?
[06:26, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: So it got fined so obviously fines arent just 50k
[06:27, 10/2/2016] Wessje: a company got fine not a person
[06:27, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Category 6 fines are 860,00 euros there
[06:27, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: In law its still a single entity
[06:28, 10/2/2016] Wessje: we are talking about uploading shit
[06:28, 10/2/2016] Wessje: not about that
[06:28, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and i told you the biggest fine for uploading movies here was like 50k
[06:29, 10/2/2016] Wessje: oh correction, 67,500 for a group of uploaders
[06:29, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Wess why are you being so dense corporate espinoge is a category 6 crime
[06:30, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: So he wouldve been fined at least 860,000 if convicted of it there
[06:30, 10/2/2016] Wessje: even if its a category 6 crime it doesnt mean they get fined in 860k m8
[06:30, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: At mininum it does
[06:31, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: If convicted
[06:31, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Of one
[06:31, 10/2/2016] Wessje: so because you read a few facts from the internet you know all about the law here?
[06:31, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: No its all basics
[06:32, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: And i have to argue over the basics of the law with you for some reason
[06:32, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Im telling you why he was
[06:32, 10/2/2016] Wessje: oh btw 860k is the MAX
[06:32, 10/2/2016] Wessje: not the MIN
[06:34, 10/2/2016] Wessje: so the fine would be between 81k and 860k
[06:34, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: You are right just skimmed it briefly because i knew you had weird info on it
[06:35, 10/2/2016] Wessje: but trust me they look at everything here before they make a big fine like that
[06:36, 10/2/2016] Wessje: i mean a fucking company that uploaded hundreds of movies got fined 67k
[06:36, 10/2/2016] Wessje: but the law here is to pussy
[06:36, 10/2/2016] Wessje: people get 5 - 15 years for most murders
[06:36, 10/2/2016] Wessje: so
[06:36, 10/2/2016] Wessje: itso its kinda retarded
[06:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: thats why im not used to big fines like that m8
[06:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: because we have a pussy law
[06:37, 10/2/2016] Wessje: wich is good but also bad
[06:38, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Its pretty common because business is very corupt so they charge a fuckton for white collar crime
[06:39, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: And I dont think media there isnt nearly as internationl sellers as american film studios
[06:40, 10/2/2016] Wessje: they upload the movies from american film studios
[06:40, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and american film studios sue them here
[06:40, 10/2/2016] Wessje: nobody here cares about dutch movies
[06:40, 10/2/2016] Wessje: they upload them to piratebay and other international websites
[06:41, 10/2/2016] Wessje: not some dutch torrenting website
[06:41, 10/2/2016] +1 (250) 879-1202: Thats probably why youll probably see those fines over people leaking company software there though
[06:41, 10/2/2016] Wessje: btw they also uploaded the revenant with 600k hits
[06:42, 10/2/2016] Wessje: yes
[06:42, 10/2/2016] Wessje: thats true
[06:42, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and thats why i think its extreme
[06:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: because here they dont do shit like that
[06:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: but whatever
[06:43, 10/2/2016] Wessje: we made our points
[06:44, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and we can finally get back to our lives again

[06:49, 10/2/2016] Wessje: and with pussy laws like this i dont think they try to scare people from committing crimes here, i think they want to help people get on the right path after they commit these crimes
[06:49, 10/2/2016] Wessje: i think i've seen a documentary of the Europeaan law system versus the american
[06:49, 10/2/2016] Wessje: i think it was something like that
